## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer who's passionate about delivering clean code and performant software. I have a successful proven track record of both individual and team contributions in organized settings, consistently taking ownership of core features.

I thrive in team environments collaborating with cross-functional teams, including designers, product managers, and back-end engineers, to achieve product and customer-centric goals. I do this by writing clean, well-tested, and maintainable code, while fostering a knowledge-sharing culture through proper documentation and training to prevent knowledge silos and minimize single points of failure. 

Having turned my hobby into a profession, I keep myself exploring new technologies and methodologies to stay up to date with the latest trends.
